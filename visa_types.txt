Additional Details

2 Important Notes
• Category Accuracy: Applicants must select a category matching their Schengen visa history. Incorrect selection leads to rejection at the visa center, with no refund of service fees.
• Family Appointments: Members must be immediate family with the same surname (except spouses).
Proof of relationship is required if surnames differ. The Visa Application Center manager may refuse
applications without valid proof.
• Family Group Category: Exclusively for children under 12 whose parents hold a visa valid for
more than 180 days.
• Registered User: The main applicant must complete the appointment process for family applications.

3 Notes for AI Application Development
• Data Structure: Create a database schema for locations, categories, visa history requirements, appointment types, and additional details. Use relational keys to link categories with locations and
appointment types.
• User Interface: Implement dropdowns for Location (ORAN 1-4, ALG 1-4), Category (ORAN 14, ALG 1-4, FAMILY GROUP), and Appointment Type (Individual, Family). Show Number of
Members ﬁeld only for Family appointments.
• Validation Logic: Validate category selection against visa history (e.g., ORAN 1/ALG 1 for no visa
or pre-2020). Use client- and server-side checks with error messages for mismatches.
• Family Appointment Handling: Require ﬁelds for each family members details and ﬁle upload
for relationship proof if surnames differ. For FAMILY GROUP, verify parent visa (> 180 days) and
child age (< 12).
• Premium Lounge Option: Add a checkbox for Premium Lounge with a tooltip stating it does not
prioritize appointments.
• Appointment Management: Support booking, managing, canceling, and reprinting appointment
letters. Track the main applicants session for family applications.
• Error Handling: Show warnings about non-refunded fees for incorrect category selection. Prompt
visa history conﬁrmation before submission.
• Localization: Support English, Spanish, French, and Arabic with a language selector.
• Security: Use secure authentication and encrypt sensitive data like relationship proofs.
• API Integration: Ensure API calls support BLS platform functions for booking, cancellation, and
letter reprinting.
